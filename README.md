## The Issue

Food and nutrition is a vital part of leading a happy, healthy life. As young adults, we have all experienced the barriers today's youth face when trying to cook for themselves. We designed Be My Chef to break down these barriers by providing the next generation the education and tools they need to develop their food autonomy.

## Our Magic Solution

Be My Chef is an innovative application that leverages users' existing social media networks to connect and inspire youth across Canada. We create an inclusive community by providing personalized recipe suggestions, customizable profiles, seamless social media integration, cross-platform support, and a school guild feature.

## How It Works

### Sign Up and Login

Users can sign up and log in through Google or Facebook accounts. At the first login, they will take a survey about food intolerances, cuisines they are interested in, and the school they attend.

### Profile

The profile page allows users to be creative and personalize their in-app experience. This includes user name, profile picture, and recent activity.

### Search for Recipes

Be My Chef has a powerful search algorithm that caters to personalized interests, as determined by the survey.

### Share to Social Media

One of the features that set our app apart is the seamless liking and sharing of recipes. This allows our app to be integrated in students' existing social networks.

### Point and Guild System

Students are put into their respective school guilds, and encouraged to participate through daily rewards and friendly competition amongst the community.

## Recommendations for Implementation

### Backend Database

In order to store information about users and recipes, we will need a backend with a database hosted on a server during the actual implementation. This will allow the frontend application to make requests to retrieve or update data through REST API calls.

### Mobile Support through React Native

Our application is based on React. With the help of React Native, it can be released as native mobile applications compatible with both Android and iOS.

## Next Steps — Future Features and Recommendations

* Allow students to add their own recipes and share them.
* Feature more events and challenges for guild competitions.
* Have a more integrated online connection with chat features.
* An interactive "Featured Recipe" stream lead by a professional chef.
* TikTok-style cooking tips for further social media integration.
